## Description:
This is an explanation of regular expressions (regex), broken down via explaining a hex-code matching regex. This guide will systematically go through a regex example ( /^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/ ), and explain each element of the code and how it is working. In particular, we will discuss describe its anchors, bracket expressions, quantifiers, OR operator, character classes, grouping and capturing and its greedy/lazy matching.
